# Persia’s Rad Rides — AI Insurance Intake Prototype
🏎️ Persia’s Rad Rides — AI Insurance Intake Prototype

Persia’s Rad Rides is a fictional mobility brand used to demonstrate an AI-assisted insurance intake workflow designed to reduce user friction, prevent invalid data entry, and eliminate downstream processing errors.

This prototype explores how early, schema-enforced validation combined with conversational UI patterns can dramatically improve data quality, security, and operational efficiency in insurance and claims-adjacent workflows.

🔍 Problem This Prototype Addresses

Traditional intake systems often validate information too late in the process, leading to:

High rates of incomplete or invalid submissions

Rework caused by missing or malformed data

Increased cognitive load for users

Risk of cross-claim data contamination

This prototype demonstrates how validating inputs at the moment of entry prevents these issues upstream.

🧠 Key Features

Step-by-step conversational intake with progressive disclosure

Schema-enforced validation at each input stage

Sensitive field masking (DOB, policy numbers)

Conditional logic to skip irrelevant steps

Zero cross-contamination data handling

Human-readable confirmation and review stage

🛠️ Technical Overview

Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS

Architecture: State-driven, field-level validation logic

Design Focus: UX clarity, error prevention, and trust signaling

Data Handling: No persistence — prototype designed for flow and validation logic demonstration only

🎯 Why This Matters

By validating structured data at the source, this approach:

Reduces downstream operational cost

Improves intake accuracy

Enhances user confidence and completion rates

Creates safer boundaries between concurrent claims
